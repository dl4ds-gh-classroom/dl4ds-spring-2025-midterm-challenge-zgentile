## CIFAR-100 Dataset
The CIFAR-100 dataset is a subset of the Tiny Images dataset. It consists of 60,000 images (50,000 train, 10,000 test). Each image is 32x32 and has RGB channels. The dataset has 100 classes, which are further grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a label for the class and superclass that it belongs to. Each class has 500 training images and 500 testing images. Each image should only have one prominent instance of the object that the class describes.
